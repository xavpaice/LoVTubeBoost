LoVTubeBoost
============

Tube based guitar/bass boost pedal

Based on the excellent Mitsumin Valvecaster
with some minor mods.

Drawn with gEDA schematic editor.

If input is from bass or guitar this works as
a basic boost pedal only.  If a low impedance input
is used of ~5v p-p it distorts quite a lot.  A small
2 x jfet preamp circuit could do that, or a second 
tube stage exactly the same as the first.

Unfortunately, tubes at such low plate voltages are
not particularly clean and don't respond too well
to control.
